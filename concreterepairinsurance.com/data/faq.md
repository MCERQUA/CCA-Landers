# Frequently Asked Questions About Concrete Repair Insurance

## What types of insurance do concrete repair contractors need?
Concrete repair contractors typically need several types of insurance including:
- General Liability Insurance
- Workers' Compensation Insurance
- Commercial Auto Insurance
- Tools and Equipment Insurance
- Professional Liability Insurance (for design-build repair projects)
- Umbrella/Excess Liability Insurance

Each provides different coverage for the various risks associated with concrete repair work, from property damage to worker injuries and design errors.

## How is concrete repair insurance different from general contractor insurance?
Concrete repair insurance is specifically tailored to the unique risks associated with concrete repair operations, including:
- Coverage for specialized concrete repair equipment
- Protection against failures of repair work
- Liability for improperly diagnosed concrete issues
- Environmental liability for concrete removal and disposal
- Coverage for specialized techniques like epoxy injection, spall repair, and resurfacing

General contractor insurance typically offers broader coverage but may lack these specialized protections critical for concrete repair contractors.

## Do I need specialized insurance for concrete crack repair?
Yes, concrete crack repair presents specific risks that require specialized coverage. Standard policies may not adequately cover:
- Damage caused by epoxy or polyurethane injection materials
- Claims related to misdiagnosed crack causes
- Structural issues that may arise after repairs
- Environmental concerns from chemical sealants
- Long-term warranty claims on repair work

Our concrete repair insurance specifically addresses these unique risks.

## How much does concrete repair contractor insurance cost?
The cost of concrete repair contractor insurance varies based on several factors:
- Your company's annual revenue
- Number of employees
- Types of repair projects you undertake
- Specialized equipment value
- Geographic location
- Claims history
- Coverage limits and deductibles

Small concrete repair contractors typically pay $2,500-$6,000 annually for a comprehensive insurance package, while larger operations with extensive projects may pay significantly more.

## Does concrete repair insurance cover damage to existing structures?
Yes, our concrete repair insurance includes coverage for damage to existing structures, which is crucial for repair contractors. This includes:
- Accidental damage during preparation work
