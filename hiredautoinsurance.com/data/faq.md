# Frequently Asked Questions About Hired Auto Insurance

## What is hired auto insurance?
Hired auto insurance provides coverage for vehicles that your business rents, leases, hires, or borrows for business purposes. This coverage protects your business from liability if an employee gets into an accident while driving a vehicle that your company doesn't own but is using for business operations.

At HiredAutoInsurance.com, we specialize in providing comprehensive hired auto coverage tailored to your specific business needs, ensuring you're protected whether you're occasionally renting vehicles or regularly using hired autos as part of your operations.

## What's the difference between hired auto and non-owned auto insurance?
While often packaged together, hired auto and non-owned auto coverages protect against different exposures:

**Hired Auto Insurance** covers vehicles your business rents, leases, or hires for business purposes. This includes rental cars, leased vehicles, or trucks hired for specific projects.

**Non-Owned Auto Insurance** covers vehicles owned by your employees when they use their personal vehicles for business purposes, such as running errands or visiting clients.

HiredAutoInsurance.com offers both coverages, often bundled together, to provide comprehensive protection for all vehicle usage scenarios your business might encounter.

## Which businesses need hired auto insurance?
Any business that rents, leases, or borrows vehicles for business purposes should consider hired auto insurance. This includes:
- Construction companies renting specialized equipment vehicles
- Businesses with traveling employees who rent cars
- Companies that occasionally lease vehicles for projects
- Delivery services using rented vans or trucks
- Event planners renting vehicles for events
- Service businesses borrowing vehicles temporarily

At HiredAutoInsurance.com, we work with businesses of all sizes and industries to determine their specific hired auto exposure and provide appropriate coverage solutions.

## Does my commercial auto policy already cover hired vehicles?
Some commercial auto policies include limited hired auto coverage, but many don't provide adequate protection or have significant exclusions. Even if your policy includes some hired auto coverage, the limits may be insufficient for your actual exposure.

HiredAutoInsurance.com specializes in reviewing your existing coverage to identify gaps and can provide supplemental hired auto insurance or a standalone policy to ensure comprehensive protection tailored to your specific business operations.

## Does the rental car company's insurance cover my business use?
The basic insurance offered by rental car companies typically provides limited coverage with high deductibles, and may exclude certain business uses or specialized vehicles. Additionally, this coverage is usually charged per day, making it expensive for regular or long-term rentals.

HiredAutoInsurance.com provides more comprehensive coverage at more competitive rates for businesses that regularly rent vehicles. Our policies are designed specifically for business use, unlike the one-size-fits-all coverage offered by rental companies.

## How much does hired auto insurance cost?
The cost of hired auto insurance varies based on several factors:
- Annual revenue of your business
- Industry and nature of operations
- Number and types of vehicles typically hired
- Driving records of employees
- Geographic area of operations
- Claims history
- Coverage limits required

At HiredAutoInsurance.com, we work with multiple carriers to find the most competitive rates for your specific situation. Hired auto coverage can often be added to existing policies for a relatively small additional premium, especially compared to the daily rates charged by rental companies.

## What limits should I carry for hired auto insurance?
Appropriate limits for hired auto insurance depend on several factors:
- Value of vehicles typically rented
- Potential liability exposure based on vehicle use
- Client or contract requirements
- Industry standards
- Risk tolerance of your business

HiredAutoInsurance.com recommends minimum limits of $1,000,000 for most businesses, but we conduct a thorough analysis of your specific operations to recommend appropriate limits that balance protection and cost.

## Does hired auto insurance cover physical damage to the rented vehicle?
Standard hired auto liability coverage only protects against third-party claims for bodily injury or property damage caused by the hired vehicle. To cover damage to the rented vehicle itself, you need hired auto physical damage coverage.

HiredAutoInsurance.com offers comprehensive hired auto insurance packages that include both liability and physical damage coverage, ensuring you're fully protected and don't have to rely on expensive collision damage waivers from rental companies.

## Are employees covered when driving rented vehicles?
Hired auto insurance typically covers authorized employees while they're operating hired vehicles for business purposes. However, coverage specifics can vary by policy and situation.

At HiredAutoInsurance.com, we can customize your policy to ensure all authorized drivers are covered appropriately, and we help you establish clear guidelines for employee use of rented vehicles to maintain coverage compliance.

## Does hired auto insurance cover long-term leased vehicles?
Coverage for long-term leased vehicles depends on the specific terms of your hired auto policy. Some policies have limitations for vehicles leased beyond a certain timeframe, after which they should be scheduled on your regular commercial auto policy.

HiredAutoInsurance.com specializes in crafting policies that address your specific leasing arrangements, whether they're short-term rentals or long-term leases, ensuring you maintain appropriate coverage for all situations.

## How does hired auto insurance work with international rentals?
Standard hired auto policies typically only provide coverage within the United States, Canada, and sometimes Puerto Rico. When renting vehicles internationally, additional coverage considerations are necessary.

HiredAutoInsurance.com offers international hired auto coverage options for businesses with global operations, ensuring consistent protection regardless of where your business rents vehicles.

## What's not covered by hired auto insurance?
Typical exclusions in hired auto policies may include:
- Personal use of hired vehicles
- Unauthorized drivers
- Certain types of specialized vehicles
- Vehicles hired in certain countries
- Intentional damage
- Violations of rental agreements

HiredAutoInsurance.com works with you to clearly understand these exclusions and can often find specialized coverage options to address gaps that might be present in standard policies.

## Do I need hired auto insurance if I have a corporate credit card that provides rental coverage?
While some corporate credit cards offer rental car insurance, these policies often have significant limitations:
- May only cover short-term rentals
- May have geographic restrictions
- Usually don't provide liability coverage, only physical damage
- May not cover all vehicle types
- May have lower limits than a dedicated policy

HiredAutoInsurance.com can review your credit card coverage and identify gaps that need to be addressed with a dedicated hired auto policy to ensure comprehensive protection.

2. Report the accident to local authorities
3. Document the scene with photos and witness information
