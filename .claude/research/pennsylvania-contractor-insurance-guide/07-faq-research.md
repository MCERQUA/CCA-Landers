**Focus:** Fundamental questions about PA contractor insurance

1. **What insurance do Pennsylvania contractors need?**
   **Answer:** Pennsylvania contractors typically need three types of insurance: Workers' compensation (mandatory for all employees), general liability insurance (required for HICPA registration at minimum $50,000/$50,000), and commercial auto insurance for business vehicles. The specific requirements depend on your business structure, number of employees, and type of work performed.
