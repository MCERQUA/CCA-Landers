# MDX Acorn Parse Error - Debug Continuation

## Current Status (as of last session)
- Working on: holder-certificate-construction-projects-guide.mdx
- Error: "[next-mdx-remote] error compiling MDX: Could not parse expression with acorn"
- Only occurs on Netlify production builds, not locally

## Binary Search Progress
1. ‚úÖ Minimal file (20 lines) - BUILDS on Netlify
2. ‚ùå Full file (1215 lines) - FAILS on Netlify  
3. ‚ùå First half (lines 1-616) - FAILS on Netlify
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è First quarter (lines 1-308) - holder-certificate-test-quarter.mdx - BUILD SUCCEEDED but 404
5. üîÑ Problem section (lines 308-616) - holder-certificate-test-section.mdx - AWAITING DEPLOYMENT

## Test Files Created
- holder-certificate-construction-projects-guide-minimal.mdx (works)
- holder-certificate-test-half.mdx (fails)
- holder-certificate-test-quarter.mdx (BUILD SUCCEEDED but page returns 404)

## Next Steps
1. Check if holder-certificate-test-quarter.mdx builds on Netlify
2. Based on result:
   - If it builds ‚Üí problem is in lines 308-616
   - If it fails ‚Üí problem is in lines 1-308
3. Continue bisecting until exact problematic section found

## GitHub Setup Complete
- Token configured: Can push with `git push origin main`
- No need for manual pushing anymore

## Important Context
- User was frustrated with repetitive "dumb" fixes (emojis, punctuation)
- Focus on finding ACTUAL problem through systematic binary search
- Check /error-tracking for list of what's been tried

## CURRENT STATUS ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ALL recent deployments showing "error" state with null error messages
- Even minimal files that should work are failing
- Renamed original file to .bak but builds still failing
- This suggests a broader build issue, not just MDX parsing

## Test Results Summary
- ‚ùå Full file (1215 lines) - Build error
- ‚ùå Half (lines 1-616) - Build error  
- ‚ùå Quarter (lines 1-308) - Build error
- ‚ùå Eighth (lines 1-154) - Build error
- ‚ùå Sixteenth (lines 1-77) - Build error
- ‚ùå Tiny (lines 1-40) - Build error
- ‚ùå Micro (lines 1-20 no GetQuoteCTA) - Build error
- ‚ùå No imports at all - Build error
- ‚ùå Copy of working minimal - Build error

## Critical Finding
- Even exact copies of previously working files are failing
- This indicates the issue is NOT with MDX content
- Need to access actual Netlify build logs to see real error
