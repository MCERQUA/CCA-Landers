        <article class="article-content">
            
            <p>Glass breakage liability represents one of the most significant financial risks facing glazing contractors today. Whether installing storefront windows, curtain walls, or specialty glass systems, even minor installation errors can result in tens of thousands of dollars in damage claims and replacement costs.</p>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <h3 class="text-white font-bold mb-2">Critical Statistic</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">According to industry data, glass breakage claims average $15,000-$50,000 per incident, with large commercial projects potentially exceeding $200,000 in damages.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Understanding Glass Breakage Liability</h2>

            <p>Glass breakage liability insurance protects glazing contractors against financial losses when glass materials break, crack, or shatter due to installation errors, handling mistakes, or accidental damage during construction projects. This specialized coverage goes beyond standard general liability to address the unique risks associated with working with expensive glass materials.</p>

            <h3>Primary Coverage Areas</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Installation Errors:</strong> Coverage for glass that breaks due to improper installation techniques, incorrect measurements, or faulty mounting systems</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation Damage:</strong> Protection against breakage during delivery and transport to job sites</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Incidents:</strong> Coverage for glass damaged while temporarily stored on construction sites</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal Stress Damage:</strong> Protection against breakage caused by temperature differential issues in installation</li>
                <li><strong>Weather-Related Breakage:</strong> Coverage for glass damaged by unexpected weather conditions during installation</li>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <p><strong>Industry Insight:</strong> Thermal shock claims represent approximately 35% of all glass breakage liability cases, making proper installation techniques critical for risk prevention.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Impact and Handling Damage</h3>
            <p>Physical damage from construction equipment, improper lifting techniques, or inadequate protection during adjacent work activities can result in substantial claims against glazing contractors.</p>

            <h3>4. Design and Specification Errors</h3>
            <p>When contractors participate in design-build projects, liability can extend to glass selection, structural adequacy, and compliance with building codes and safety standards.</p>

            <h2>Coverage Limits and Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Policy Limit Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Per Occurrence Limits:</strong> Typically range from $100,000 to $2 million depending on project scope</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregate Limits:</strong> Annual maximum coverage often set at 2-3 times the per occurrence limit</li>
                <li><strong>Deductible Options:</strong> Usually $1,000-$10,000 per claim, with higher deductibles reducing premium costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Material Value Considerations</h3>
            <p>High-end projects involving specialty glass, smart glass technology, or architectural glass features may require enhanced coverage limits to adequately protect against potential losses.</p>

            <div class="coverage-card">
                <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mb-3">Coverage Enhancement Options</h3>
                <ul class="mb-0">
                    <li>Extended coverage for glass in transit and storage</li>
                    <li>Protection against design liability exposure</li>
                    <li>Coverage for temporary protective materials and emergency boarding</li>
                    <li>Business interruption protection for project delays</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Risk Management Best Practices</h2>

                <h3 class="text-white font-bold mb-2">Key Takeaway</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">Glass breakage liability insurance is essential protection for glazing contractors, but prevention through proper installation techniques, quality control, and risk management remains the most effective approach to minimizing exposure.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Selecting the Right Coverage</h2>

            <p>Regular policy reviews ensure coverage keeps pace with business growth, changing project types, and evolving industry standards. Annual reviews should assess coverage limits, deductibles, and any new exclusions or requirements.</p>

            <div class="coverage-card">
                <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mb-3">Questions to Ask Your Insurance Agent</h3>
                <ul class="mb-0">
                    <li>Does the policy cover both material replacement and labor costs?</li>
