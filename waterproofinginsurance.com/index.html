            <h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Why do waterproofing contractors need specialized insurance?</h3>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">Waterproofing contractors face unique risks that general contractors don't encounter:- Long-term liability for water intrusion issues- Chemical exposure from sealants and coatings- Potential environmental contamination- Project failures that may not be immediately apparent- Higher consequential damage potential (mold, structural damage)- Extended completed operations exposure- Specialized equipment risks</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What does general liability insurance cover for waterproofing contractors?</h3>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">General liability insurance for waterproofing contractors typically covers:- Third-party bodily injury (customer or visitor injuries)- Third-party property damage- Completed operations liability (issues arising after project completion)- Personal and advertising injury- Legal defense costs- Settlements and judgments</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">WaterproofingInsurance.com ensures your general liability policy includes proper completed operations coverage, which is particularly important for waterproofing contractors since water intrusion issues may not become apparent until months or years after project completion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item" style="">
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do I need pollution liability insurance for waterproofing work?</h3>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">Yes, pollution liability insurance is essential for waterproofing contractors due to:- Use of potentially hazardous chemicals in sealants and coatings- Risk of spills or improper application affecting soil or water- Fume and vapor exposure to building occupants- Potential for improper disposal claims- Long-term environmental impact concerns</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">Standard general liability policies typically exclude pollution-related claims. WaterproofingInsurance.com includes appropriate pollution liability coverage in our waterproofing contractor insurance packages to protect against these specific exposures.</p>

            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">Standard insurance policies often exclude mold-related claims. For waterproofing contractors, this creates a significant exposure that requires specialized coverage.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">WaterproofingInsurance.com works with carriers who can provide mold coverage endorsements or separate policies to protect against this common consequence of waterproofing failures, which standard policies typically exclude.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Does my insurance cover me if I offer waterproofing warranties?</h3>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">Standard insurance policies may not cover voluntary warranty programs or extended guarantees.
