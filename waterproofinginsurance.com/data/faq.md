## Why do waterproofing contractors need specialized insurance?
Waterproofing contractors face unique risks that general contractors don't encounter:
- Long-term liability for water intrusion issues
- Chemical exposure from sealants and coatings
- Potential environmental contamination
- Project failures that may not be immediately apparent
- Higher consequential damage potential (mold, structural damage)
- Extended completed operations exposure
- Specialized equipment risks

WaterproofingInsurance.com provides policies specifically designed for these unique exposures, ensuring you're not left with dangerous coverage gaps that standard contractor policies might not address.

## What does general liability insurance cover for waterproofing contractors?
General liability insurance for waterproofing contractors typically covers:
- Third-party bodily injury (customer or visitor injuries)
- Third-party property damage
- Completed operations liability (issues arising after project completion)
- Personal and advertising injury
- Legal defense costs
- Settlements and judgments

WaterproofingInsurance.com ensures your general liability policy includes proper completed operations coverage, which is particularly important for waterproofing contractors since water intrusion issues may not become apparent until months or years after project completion.

## Do I need pollution liability insurance for waterproofing work?
Yes, pollution liability insurance is essential for waterproofing contractors due to:
- Use of potentially hazardous chemicals in sealants and coatings
- Risk of spills or improper application affecting soil or water
- Fume and vapor exposure to building occupants
- Potential for improper disposal claims
- Long-term environmental impact concerns

Standard general liability policies typically exclude pollution-related claims. WaterproofingInsurance.com includes appropriate pollution liability coverage in our waterproofing contractor insurance packages to protect against these specific exposures.

## What happens if my waterproofing work fails and causes damage?
If your waterproofing application fails and causes damage, you could face significant liability claims. Your insurance should cover:
- Cost to repair or replace the failed waterproofing
- Resulting water damage to the structure
- Mold remediation expenses
- Business interruption claims from commercial clients
- Defense costs for lawsuits alleging faulty workmanship

WaterproofingInsurance.com ensures your policy includes completed operations coverage with appropriate limits and duration, as waterproofing failures may not become evident for months or years after project completion.

## Are my specialized waterproofing tools and equipment covered?
Standard business insurance often doesn't adequately cover specialized equipment. Waterproofing contractors need:
- Coverage for sprayers and application equipment
- Protection for mixing tools and pumps
- Coverage for portable generators and compressors
- Protection for specialized testing equipment
- Coverage while equipment is in transit or at job sites

WaterproofingInsurance.com includes appropriate inland marine/contractor's equipment coverage that protects your valuable specialized equipment wherever it's locatedâ€”at your shop, in transit, or at job sites.

## Does my insurance cover damage to expensive membranes or materials on the job site?
Standard insurance may not cover materials awaiting installation. Waterproofing contractors need installation floater coverage that protects:
- Expensive waterproofing membranes
- Specialized coatings and sealants
- Custom-mixed materials
- Materials in transit or stored at job sites

WaterproofingInsurance.com can include installation floater coverage in your policy to ensure your valuable materials are protected until they're properly installed and the project is completed.

WaterproofingInsurance.com understands these distinctions and provides coverage appropriate to the specific waterproofing services you offer.

## Are my employees covered when handling waterproofing chemicals?
Employees' workplace injuries are covered by workers' compensation insurance, which is essential for waterproofing contractors due to:
- Chemical exposure risks
- Respiratory hazards from fumes
- Skin contact with irritating substances
- Physical injuries from application equipment
- Confined space entry risks in some applications

WaterproofingInsurance.com can help you secure appropriate workers' compensation coverage that recognizes the unique exposures of waterproofing work, potentially qualifying for better rates through safety program implementation.

## What about insurance for vehicles that transport waterproofing equipment and materials?
Commercial auto insurance is crucial for waterproofing contractors who:
- Transport chemicals and sealants between job sites

WaterproofingInsurance.com ensures your commercial auto policy considers the unique aspects of transporting waterproofing materials, including potential pollution exposures from accidents involving chemical transport.

## Does my insurance cover claims related to mold resulting from waterproofing failures?
Standard insurance policies often exclude mold-related claims. For waterproofing contractors, this creates a significant exposure that requires specialized coverage.

WaterproofingInsurance.com works with carriers who can provide mold coverage endorsements or separate policies to protect against this common consequence of waterproofing failures, which standard policies typically exclude.

## Are spray-applied waterproofing applications covered differently than membrane applications?
Yes, different application methods carry different risk profiles:

**Spray-Applied Coatings:**
