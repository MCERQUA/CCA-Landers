            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Commercial kitchen fire prevention requires a comprehensive approach combining proper equipment maintenance, regular professional hood cleaning, employee training, and adequate insurance coverage. The devastating impact of kitchen fires makes prevention not just a regulatory requirement, but a critical business necessity.</p>

            <p>By implementing robust fire prevention measures, maintaining compliance with NFPA 96 standards, and ensuring adequate insurance protection, commercial food service operations can significantly reduce their fire risk while protecting employees, customers, and business investments.</p>

            <p>The key to effective fire prevention lies in treating it as an ongoing operational priority rather than a compliance burden. With proper planning, professional partnerships, and comprehensive coverage, commercial kitchens can operate safely while maintaining the operational efficiency essential for business success.</p>
